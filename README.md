## Homework \#02 "Data Structure Problems"

1) **Rotate Array**  
Given an array, rotate the array to the right by _k_ steps, where _k_ is non-negative  
Example:  
    ```
    Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] and k = 3
    Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
    Explanation:  
    rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]  
    rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]  
    rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]  
    ```
2) **Reverse Linked List**  
Reverse a singly linked list  
Example:
    ```
    Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
    Output: 5->4->3->2->1->NULL
    ```
3) **Binary Tree Paths**  
Given a binary tree, return all roof-to-leaf paths.  
Note: A leaf is a node with no children.  
Example:  
    ```
    Input:
    
       1
     /   \
    2     3
     \
      5
    
    Output: ["1->2->5", "1->3"]
    Explanation: All root-to-leaf paths are: 1->2->5, 1->3
    ```
